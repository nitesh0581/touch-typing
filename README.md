The touch typing application is a typing tutor that helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It provides a practice environment where users can type a series of keys or words, while visually guiding them on the keys they should type next. It also measures the number of keys pressed within a 5-minute window and calculates the accuracy percentage.

Advantages of a touch typing application:
1. Improved Typing Speed: By providing a structured practice environment, the application helps users increase their typing speed over time. Regular practice can lead to faster and more efficient typing, which is useful in various contexts such as work, school, or personal use.
2. Enhanced Accuracy: The application measures accuracy, encouraging users to focus on typing with precision. With practice, users can minimize typing errors, resulting in more accurate and error-free typing.
3. Muscle Memory Development: Touch typing emphasizes using all fingers and placing them on specific keys. Through repetition and muscle memory development, users can eventually type without looking at the keyboard, increasing their typing speed and efficiency.
4. Time Savings: Faster and accurate typing can save considerable time when performing tasks involving typing, such as writing documents, coding, or sending emails. A touch typing application can help users save time by improving their overall typing skills.

Functionalities:
1. Typing Box: The typing box is where the user types the keys or words provided. It allows users to practice typing while monitoring their progress.
2. Visual Guidance: The application visually displays the next keys or words the user should type. This feature helps users stay focused and aware of what they need to type next.
3. Key Press Measurement: The application tracks the number of keys pressed within a 5-minute window. This metric provides a measure of the user's typing speed and allows for progress monitoring over time.
4. Accuracy Measurement: The application calculates the accuracy percentage by comparing the user's typed input with the expected keys or words. It helps users identify and work on improving typing accuracy.

Use cases solved by a touch typing application:
1. Typing Skill Improvement: Individuals who want to enhance their typing skills, whether for personal or professional reasons, can use the touch typing application to practice and develop their abilities.
2. Keyboard Familiarity: The application can be helpful for those who are new to a keyboard layout or have recently switched to a different layout. It allows users to become familiar with the keys and improve their overall typing proficiency.
3. Job Requirements: Some job positions may require strong typing skills, such as data entry, transcription, or customer support. A touch typing application can assist individuals in meeting the typing speed and accuracy requirements for such roles.
4. Academic Use: Students who need to type assignments, research papers, or take notes during classes can benefit from the touch typing application to improve their typing speed and accuracy, allowing them to complete tasks more efficiently.

In summary, a touch typing application provides a practice environment for users to improve their typing speed and accuracy. It offers visual guidance, measures the number of keys pressed and accuracy percentage, and can be used to enhance typing skills for various purposes.
